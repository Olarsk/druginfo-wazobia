Although the beneﬁt of gastric decontamination is uncertain, charcoal, activated p. 1481 should be considered if the patient presents within 1 hour of ingesting paracetamol in excess of 150 mg/kg. Patients at risk of liver damage and therefore requiring acetylcysteine, can be identiﬁed from a single measurement of the plasma-paracetamol concentration related to the time from ingestion, provided this time interval is not less than 4 hours; earlier samples cannot be interpreted. The concentration is plotted on a paracetamol treatment graph, with a reference line (‘treatment line’) joining plots of 100 mg/litre (0.66 mmol/litre) at 4 hours and 3.13 mg/litre (0.02 mmol/litre) at 24 hours, see Paracetamol overdose treatment graph.
